🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis — Excel & Power BI Dashboard Project
This project dives into the world of video game sales, where I explored how genre, platform, publisher, and time of release influence global sales trends. The dataset includes sales numbers from popular titles like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty, broken down by region, console, and release year.
